<!-- A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, usually square image or icon associated with a website. Favicons are displayed in the browser's tab, bookmarks bar, and bookmarks menu when a user visits a website. They serve as a visual identifier for the site and help users quickly recognize and locate it among their open tabs or bookmarks. -->

<!-- Here's an illustrative example of how to include a favicon in your HTML code: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <!-- Favicon -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
    
    <!-- Other metadata and CSS, if needed -->
    <title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your website content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
